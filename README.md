My myopic dot-files
==========

Yet another dot-file repository, in the style of `oh-my-zsh`Â and other such frameworks, but much more *myopic*, in that although it may well work for others, they would generally be much better off installing more comprehensive frameworks.

These files are not intended to be placed directly into the root directory. Rather, the recommended installation procedure is to clone this into a subdirectory (e.g. ~/myopic) and include each file from the corresponding default configuration file.

Contents
